=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::MinimumVersion - Author tests for minimum required versions

=head1 VERSION

version 2.000011

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In C<dist.ini>:

    [Test::MinimumVersion]
    max_target_perl = 5.10.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for Pod::Coverage register_prereqs

=for Pod::Coverage FILENAME gather_files munge_file register_prereqs

This is an extension of L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles>, providing a
L<Test::MinimumVersion> test:

  xt/author/minimum-version.t - a standard Test::MinimumVersion test

You should provide the highest perl version you want to require as
C<target_max_version>. If you accidentally use perl features that are newer
than that version number, then the test will fail, and you can go change
whatever bumped up the minimum perl version required.
